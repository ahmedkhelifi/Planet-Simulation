# Planet-Simulation
Java based program that simulates our solar system and the movement of the planets around the sun.

The current development plan:
1- finish adding the known planets in our galaxy
2- adjust the distance between the planets (real scaling)
3- add a mechanism to control the cycle speed of the planets around the sun and themselves
